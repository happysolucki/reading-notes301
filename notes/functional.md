# Functional Programming

### Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?

  It is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and values immutability

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

  A function that:
  - returns the same result when given the same arguments
  - doesn't cause any observable side effects

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

  Increased testability and reliablity

4. What is immutability?

  When the state of some data can't be changed after its creation

5. What is Referential transparency?

  When a function consistently yields the same result when given the same input. A simple equation is this:

  pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

## JS Modules

1. What is a module?

2. What does the word 'require' do?

3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
