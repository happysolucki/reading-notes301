# Components & Props

### Components

A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface. Components typically possess these characteristics:

- Reusability (Focused on one task or adaptable/flexible to different situations in different applications)
- Replaceable (Can be substituted with other similar components)
- Not context specific (Can suit different environments/contexts)
- Extensible (Can be extended from other components to provide new behavior)
- Encapsulated (Doesn't expose internal processes, variables, or state)
- Independent (Minimal dependence on other components)

The perks that come with component-based development are:

- Ease of deployment (easier to update/replace existing version without impacting other components or the system)
- Reduced cost
- Ease of development (well-defined functionality allows development w/o impacting other parts of the system)
- Reusable
- Modification of technical complexity
- Reliability (reliability of each component enhances the reliability of the entire system)
- System maintenance and evolution (easy to alter or update implementation without affecting the rest of the system)
- Independent (flexible connectivity of components)

### Props

Props, in the context of React, is short for properties. Props are used to communicate data between components. Props in react are always passed unidirectionally from parent to child.
